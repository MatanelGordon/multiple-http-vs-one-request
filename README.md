# multiple http vs one request
This repo allows to test the difference between one http request vs. multiple http requests. 
I built this using vite + express + vanillajs + tailwindcss
## getting started
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

## changing number of requests
- variable `parts` in `apps/backend/src/index.js`

## changing frontend address
- variable `serverRoute` in `apps/frontend/main.js`
